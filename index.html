          <p class="hidden">I joined as Cloudflare was re-establishing the design team and help build it to the team we have today. My role at Clouflare involves primarily desiging new features and updated existing ones. Our team built the design system from the ground up, hiring the next 10 designers, rebranded our old style from 2008, massively improved our front-end workflow and worked on hundreds of smaller side projects as well. Over the years, I felt that I learnt the most at developing and refining my design process and also ability to work with larger and more complex teams. My goal moving forward is to continue to grow and share my learnings, experiences and failures.</p>

      		<p class="main">I designed and help built an annoymous chat app.</p><a class="toggle">[Read More]</a>
          <p class="hidden">Truth is a annoymous chat app that allows you to send annoymous messages to your contacts but they won't know its you. We started out with a crazy idea one night in Vancouver and it took us across the continent and back. We got accepted into FounderFuel in Montreal for 5 months and after the accelerator program ended we set up office in San Francisco. I was the third person in the company as the main designer and community manger. We worked through many iterations and redesigns and managed to get it up to over 30,000 messages sent by users at our peak. In the end we lost momentum, disbanded, and the company assets got aquired.</p>
